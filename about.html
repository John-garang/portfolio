                        <p>I like lions— in all their greatness, they represent majesty, strength, courage, justice, and military might. And to add to it, it's known as the king of beasts. Their awe-inspiring strength and dominance captures my imagination.</p>

                        <p>Don't carry any guilt for the past. Don't carry baggage. Leave everything that's holding you back, leave everything that holds you from soaring high. Don't look back. It's a new day, new fight, fight hard, very hard, but fight clean. Don't carry any amount of guilt. You won't be able to run fast and long in life. Never look back on the past. Nobody knows your heart better than you. Trust your instincts. Never let anyone cast a shadow on your sunshine.</p>
