            <h2>Global Learning Experiences Department</h2>
            <p>The Global Learning Experiences (GLE) Department at ALU is where classrooms break their walls and learning becomes borderless. Its mission is to connect ALU students to transformative opportunities that sharpen their leadership, deepen their perspectives, and plug them into global ecosystems of innovation and impact.</p>
            
            <p>GLE curates and facilitates international experiences, from exchange programs and global competitions to field immersions and innovation labs, designed to stretch students beyond comfort zones. These aren't traditional study-abroad programs or touristy internships. They're immersive, high-stakes learning journeys where students confront real-world challenges, collaborate with peers from around the globe, and return with skills and networks that accelerate their growth as entrepreneurial leaders.</p>

                    <h2>Hub Ambassador Experience</h2>
                    <p>In April 2023, I joined the Accra Fusion Signature Immersive Experience in Ghana under ALU's Global Learning Experiences Department. I stepped into this program not only as a participant but as the Hub Ambassador, helping to shape the experience from its very beginning.</p>
                    
                    <p>From the planning stages, I worked closely with the GLE team to map out the program, navigating the many moving parts that come with coordinating an international immersion. I connected with the organizations that hosted our students during the SIE, forged partnerships, and helped design trips that combined academic learning with real-world exposure.</p>

                <p>Being part of the Accra Fusion SIE was both a professional challenge and a personal joy.

For me, Accra was not just a city we visited; it became a classroom, a collaborator, and a mirror reflecting the power of experiential learning.</p>
