                <p style="color: #666; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) was launched by the United States government as a signature effort to invest in the next generation of African leaders. The need to invest in grooming strong, results-oriented leaders comes out of the statistics: nearly 1 in 3 Africans are between the ages of 10 and 24, and approximately 60% of Africa's total population is below the age of 35.</p>
                
                <p style="color: #666; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 0;">Who will empower and lead these young Africans? Who will shape the future of business and entrepreneurship, civic leadership, and public management? In order to answer these questions, YALI promotes three models designed to identify and empower young leaders: the YALI Mandela Washington Fellowship, YALI Network, and the establishment of Regional Leadership Centers across Africa.</p>
