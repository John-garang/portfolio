                        <p class="lead">Educated women can read through you like the book you never finished.</p>

                <p>"I can't date an educated woman.</p>

                <p>Educated women are arrogant, old, too proud, don't respect men, and other stories… Girls from East Africa are this and that…"</p>

                <p>You've heard this, maybe you've even said it.</p>

                <p>I'm not surprised this half-baked statement mostly rolls out the tongue of a high school dropout whose only achievement is not dying. A broad-chested gym cow whose almost empty brain migrated to the armpits. An obese campus foodie who can name 40 street food vendors within a 200m radius but can't name five course-mates. The guy who spends more time at tea stalls than in class; or the illiterate ones( I don't even want to describe these ones, because it's like someone without a passport saying I hate flying on KQ, brooo, even if you loved it, would you fly them?</p>

                <p>In all honesty bro, sit your tired ass down. No illiterate lady wants you, let alone an educated one. First of all what's there to love about you? No money, no sense of humor, and on top of all that, good looks are futilely looking for you. You look like you were an Angel's MVP that was pitched to God, but was rejected for funding (creation), and yet went on to launch.</p>

                <p>The truth is educated women can reflect and reason. They can see through you; through your borrowed poorly-stiched suit, through those iPhone-filtered photos, through your poorly rehearsed intellectual posts, through your fragile lies, and the list goes on. They can see you naked and empty, mentally, emotionally, physically, and financially. And once she sees all that's really there is a hollow, bitter man, they walk away. That's what you call pride? Good sir, would you want your sister to marry a man as empty and idle as you? I didn't think so, so we're clear.</p>

                <p>Let's be real, you're not scared of her education. She turned down your advances because you're ugly. She's not showing off her English, she just speaks with more ease and actual fluency. She's not old, she's just too mature to fall for your pity traps. And I know good sir that it burns. It's burns to be seen for the mediocre, clueless, dusty-footed disgrace you are.</p>

                <p>Let's be honest, arrogance, disrespect, and pride? No school teaches that; they are from home, and even illiterate women carry them around like house keys.</p>

                <p>Feminists excluded, the way someone behaves isn't about high school diplomas or degrees. It's about how they were raised. There are women walking around Kampala right now who've never seen the inside of a classroom, let alone met a professor. Yet they are the loudest, most entitled, and most delusional beings on two legs. Their only achievement is curves and a big behind that somehow managed to trigger the pity of a dry spell lost boy blinded by hormones. And these very chicken-brains with the IQ of a boiled potato are the one's flaunting their empty heads on heels on the streets of Kampala, attending every show and treating every relative of their husband like trash cans.</p>

                <p>Now good sir, forgive my tone, please change your statement and say "I can't date an educated woman. Educated women are self aware, mature, confident, and respect men who deserve to be respected."</p>

                        <p>If you're still angry and hungry, I'm at the usual place, the blue bar in pap 3. Pull up!</p>
